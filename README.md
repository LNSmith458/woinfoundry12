# Maintenance Note
Attempting to update WoinFoundry to work on Foundry12

# WOINFoundry
WOINFoundry adds support for WOIN to Foundry. I made this system for my groups NEW game (so the theming and compendiums support NEW), but this should be able to support OLD, NOW, etc just without compendiums.

Contributions for other compendiums would be appreciated.

Currently the system runs stable on foundry v9, though given the upgrade was recent there may be some bugs (please report them if you run into any).
